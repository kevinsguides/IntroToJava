# IntroToJava

Intro to Java is part of Kevin's Guides - Intro to Java Series. The purpose of this project is to go through all the paces of a standard Computer Science 1 course for free.
Users will be taught fundamental object oriented programming concepts from a functional standpoint. In later chapters, we will dive into the science behind why the code is
doing what it's doing.
